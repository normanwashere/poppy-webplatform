    // This is the root page of your application.
    // It will typically contain your main router logic.
    // For now, we will put the full application logic here.
    import { onMount } from 'svelte';

    // For now, all HTML and JS from the final single-file artifact goes here.
    // This is not ideal SvelteKit structure, but it's the most direct translation
    // of the previous request.
</script>

<!-- All of the HTML from the <body> of the final single-file artifact goes here -->
<!-- You would then need to extract the JavaScript into the <script> tag above -->
<!-- and manage state using Svelte stores. -->

<p class="text-center font-bold text-2xl">Application logic would be initialized here.</p>
